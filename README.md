# WEB501Project1
## Project 1 for WEB501 - JavaScript IV

A website for a fictitious business called __Keys &amp; Boards Galore__. The site is composed of an index, product pages for keyboards & keycaps as well as a page containing shipping information.

## Features

Keys &amp; Boards Galore is a static website featuring four Markdown pages, Sass &amp; TypeScript. The project will include a Gulp file to process the files into HTML, CSS &amp; JavaScript respectively. Once processed, gulp will compress the CSS file while also and concatenating & compressing jQuery & the newly processed JS file. It will also watch for file changes and refresh the browser to then show the changes. The index features a hero image as well as some placeholder text. There are two product pages. One listing keyboards to purchase &amp; the other for Keycaps. Both pages use CSS grid for layout and is reponsive at two breakpoints. Going from a 3 column, to a 2 column, to a 1 column layout. Every product has an *Add To Cart* button. When one of those buttons is pressed, TypeScript will increment the cart nav item while you are on that page. However, it only increments on the page itself. So it is not persistent throughout the site. The shipping page uses a markdown table with predetermined (i.e. made up) shipping estimates.
